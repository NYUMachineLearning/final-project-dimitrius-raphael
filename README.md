#Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer Challenge


Attached is my Final presentation and accompanying R Code. For this project, I analyzed data from the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer DREAM Challenge, focusing primarily on Subchallenge I. For this project, I performed data preprocessing methods, exploratory data analyses, feature selection, predictive model building, and validation using RMSE.
